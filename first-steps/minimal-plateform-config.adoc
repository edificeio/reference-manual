== Import a structure data set

In ODE platefom a structure is typically a school or a grouping of school. 
The user's data feeding process is designed around this notion of strucutre, 
because schools are the "master data" of user's identity. 

* Connect with the default super user : `tom.mate` / `password`
* Go to URL : http://localhost:8090/directory/wizard (it's the CSV's import wizard)
* Use the test data set place in `path-tospringboard/sample-be1d/EcoleprimaireEmileZola` folder

Fill the form as follow in the screenshot below

** `CSVExtraction-eleves.csv` for *Students*
** `CSVExtraction-enseignants.csv` for *Teachers*
** `CSVExtraction-responsables.csv` for *Parents*
* Click *Start imporrt* on the Step 2 screen
* Click *Finish* on the Step 3 screen (The next message is displyed : "Your import has been successfully completed")

== Configure application roles

In ODE plateform, each application provides its set of fined grained permissions.
You have to group the permissions into high level roles before granting user's access.

* Go to http://localhost:8090/appregistry/admin-console
* Chose "*Application roles*" menu
* Enter "_Message_" in left search field and select the application called * "_Messagerie_"
